## Tutorial

### Managing your Bakery with PowerBake!

This tutorial will guide you through the process of managing your bakery with **PowerBake**. When you're done you'll be familiar with the typical workflow of PowerBake!

### Step 1: Adding a Client

**Purpose:** Before we can start managing our bakery, we need to have a list of our [clients](#glossary).

Imagine you hava a new client, **Luke**, who has just placed an order with you. Lets add him to PowerBake!

To add him to PowerBake, use this [command](#glossary) in the Command Box

```add client Luke -p 88776655 -a 5 Punggol Street -e luke@gmail.com   ```

<img src="images/add_luke.png" alt="Add Luke" width="800"/>

This command specifies the following details about Luke:
- **Name:** Luke
- **Phone Number:** 88776655 using the ```-p``` flag
- **Address:** 5 Punggol Street using the ```-a``` flag
- **Email**: luke@gmail.com using the ```-e``` flag

After hitting Enter, you should see a message indicating that Luke has been successfully added to PowerBake and the new entry should appear in the List View.

<img src="images/added_luke.png" alt="added luke into powerbake" width="800"/>

1. The **List View** will display the details of Luke.

**Congrats!** You have successfully added your first client to PowerBake!

### Step 2: Adding a Pastry

**Purpose:** Now that we have a client, we need to add the pastries that we offer to our clients.

So far we have created new a new client, **Luke**. Now, lets add a new pastry, **Croissant**, to PowerBake!

To add the Croissant to PowerBake, use this [command](#glossary) in the Command Box and hit Enter:

```add pastry Croissant -pr 5.5```

<img src="images/add_pastry.png" alt="Adding Croissant into powerbake" width="800"/>

This command specifies the following details about the Croissant:

- **Price:** $5.50 using the ```-pr``` flag

Hitting Enter will display a message indicating that the Croissant has been **successfully added** to PowerBake and the new entry should appear in the List View.

1. The **Result Display Box** will show a message indicating that the Croissant has been successfully added.
1. The **List View** will display the details of the Croissant.

**Nice!** You have successfully added your **first pastry** to PowerBake!

### Step 3: Adding an Order

**Purpose:** Now that we have a **client** and a **pastry**, we can start taking **orders!**

Lets say **Luke** has placed an order for 2 **Croissants** and 2 **Apple Pies**. Lets add this order to PowerBake!

To add the order to PowerBake, use this [command](#glossary) in the Command Box and hit Enter:

```add order Luke -pn Croissant -q 2```

<box type="tip" >

You can add multiple pastries in a single order by sequentialy pecifying the pastry and quantity for each pastry using the ```-pn``` and ```-q``` flags.
**For Example:** ```add order Luke -pn Croissant -q 2 -pn Apple Pie -q 2 -pn Tart -q 3 ...```

</box>

<img src="images/add_order.png" alt="Adding order into powerbake" width="800"/>

This command specifies the following details about the order:
- **Client:** Luke using the **index** of the client
- **Pastry:** Croissant using the ```-pn``` flag
- **Quantity:** 2 using the ```-q``` flag

Hitting Enter will display a message indicating that the order has been **successfully added** to PowerBake and the new entry should appear in the List View.

<img src="images/added_order.png" alt="added order into powerbake" width="800"/>

<box type="info" seamless>

New Orders **automatically** have the status of **Pending**.

</box>

1. The **Result Display Box** will show a message indicating that the order has been successfully added.

## Storage 

This section will go through how order, pastry and customer details are stored.

### Saving Data

*PowerBake* data is saved automatically after any command that adds, deletes or edit. There is no need for any manual saving.


### Editing the Data File
**CAUTION:**
Adding data in the wrong format could lead to potential errors.

*PowerBake* data is saved in `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`., experienced users can add or delete clients and pastries within the json file.

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
