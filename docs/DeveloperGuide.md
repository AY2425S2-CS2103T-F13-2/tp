## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/powerbake/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/powerbake/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/powerbake/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `PastryListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI. Such as methods which help load the FXML files. Due to the sheer number of components inhering from the abstract `UiPart` class, the inheritance has been shown in the diagram below instead.

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram2.puml" alt="Inheritance from UiPart class"/>

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/powerbake/address/ui/common/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/powerbake/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/powerbake/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="1000"/>


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data.
1. all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
2. all `Pastry` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePastryList` object).
3. all `Order` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueOrderList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* same idea applies to `Pastry` and `Order` objects.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/powerbake/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="750" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in [JSON](#glossary) format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `powerbake.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes how some noteworthy features were implemented.

### `add order` - Add Order

This command enables the addition of an Order for a specified Client in the Model. Its implementation involves validating client existence, pastry availability, and coordinating updates between the Model and UI components.

As a refresher, this is the add order command as described in the User Guide:

<box type="info" seamless>

Format: add order CLIENT_INDEX -pn PASTRY_NAME -q QUANTITY [-pn PASTRY_NAME -q QUANTITY]

Example: add order 1 -pn Croissant -q 10 -pn Apple Pie -q 20 adds an order for the client at index 1
with 10 Croissants and 20 Apple Pies.

</box>

#### Overview

When executed, this command parses user input and creates an internal representation of the order data. The sequence proceeds as follows:

1. **Parse Command and Validate Client**:
   - The input command text is parsed to identify the client index and order details
   - The system validates that the client index exists in the current filtered client list
   - If the client is found, the process continues with validating pastry items

2. **Validate Pastry Items**:
   - For each pastry name specified, the system checks if it exists in the current pastry list
   - The system ensures no duplicate pastry entries exist in a single order
   - Valid quantities are checked for each pastry

3. **Create and Add Order**:
   - A new Order object is created with the validated client and a list of OrderItem objects
   - Each OrderItem contains a reference to a Pastry and its quantity
   - The order is automatically assigned a "pending" status

4. **Model Update**:
   - The model adds the new order to the address book, which updates the internal list of orders
   - This triggers observers to notify relevant UI components

5. **Automatic UI Refresh**:
   - The OrderListPanel UI component, which observes changes in the list of orders, detects the addition and refreshes its display
   - The UI reflects this change by showing a new OrderCard for the recently added order

<box type="tip" seamless>

The Order implementation uses a unique identifier (OrderId) that's automatically generated to ensure orders can be uniquely identified in the system, even when multiple orders come from the same client.

## **Appendix: planned enhancements**

1. **Enhance client and pastry name validation**

Currently, PowerBake only allows alphanumeric characters and spaces in client and pastry names. This is a limitation as
some names may contain special characters such as slashes, hyphens, accented characters and different languages. In the future, we will enhance the validation to allow these characters.
so that names such as Nagaratnam s/o Suppiah, Anya Taylor-Joy, Sergio PÃ©rez, etc.. can be added to our system. Additionally, PowerBake currently allows for multiple consecutive spaces in
names. This should not be allowed as it leads to inconsistent formatting and validation.

Proposed Changes:
- loosen restrictions to allow for special characters and accented characters. widening the scope of names that can be added to the system.
- Trim consecutive spaces to a single space. This will ensure that names are formatted consistently and correctly.

These changes are expected to improve PowerBake's consistency and usability.

2. **Include command overview in the help pop-up**

Currently, the help pop-up only contains a link to the User Guide online. However this could be unintuitive as users have to copy the link and open the browser to access the User Guide.
Information such as an overview of the commands should be readily available in the help pop-up. This will allow users to quickly access the information they need without having to leave the app.

Proposed Changes:
- Add a command overview to the help pop-up.

This will provide users with a quick reference to the available commands and their usage.

3. **Enhance add order functionality with batch processing**

Currently, users can only create one order at a time, requiring separate command executions for multiple clients even when they're ordering the same pastries. This is inefficient for bakery owners who often process similar bulk orders for different clients.

Proposed Changes:
- Implement a new batch order command syntax that allows multiple client orders to be created simultaneously
- Enable specifying multiple client indices when the pastry selections are identical
- Add validation to ensure all client indices are valid before processing any orders

These improvements would significantly reduce the time spent on data entry for bakery owners who process multiple similar orders in a single session.

4. **Improve email validation for clients**

PowerBake's current email validation doesn't fully verify that email addresses contain valid top-level domains (TLDs). This can lead to accepting technically invalid email addresses that won't function for client communications.

Proposed Changes:
- Enhance email validation to verify the presence of a valid TLD (e.g., .com, .org, .net)

This improvement will help ensure that client contact information is accurate and functional, reducing communication failures.

5. **Enhance order editing capabilities**

Currently, PowerBake only allows changing the status of an existing order using the "edit order" command. If a baker  wants to modify an order by changing the quantity or removing a pastry item,
the entire order must be deleted and recreated. This process is time-consuming and can lead to errors.

Proposed Changes:
- Extend the existing "edit order" command to allow modification of individual pastry quantities
- Add functionality to remove specific pastry items from an existing order
- Enable addition of new pastry items to an already created order

These enhancements will make order management more flexible and efficient, improving customer service and reducing the chances of data entry errors.

6. **Enhance search functionality with filtering and sorting capabilities**

The current search functionality for clients/pastries/orders only allows searching by name. This limitation makes it difficult to quickly locate items
based on other important criteria such as phone number, address, price, order status, date, pastry type, etc...

Proposed Changes:
- Extend the find command to support additional search parameters including phone number, address, price, order status, date, pastry type, etc...
- Implement sorting capabilities for search results based on different attributes (phone number, price, order date, etc...)
- Add combined filtering options to narrow search results using multiple criteria simultaneously

These improvements will give bakery owners more powerful tools to manage their workflow, especially when dealing with a large volume of items.

7. **Make certain fields optional when adding clients**

Currently, these fields (name, phone, address, email) are mandatory when adding a client. However, there may be situations where certain information is not available at the time of client creation,
such as some clients who may lack an email address.

Proposed Changes:
- Make the email and address fields optional when adding a new client
- Provide visual indicators in the UI for clients with incomplete information
- Add the ability to update client profiles later when the missing information becomes available

These changes will make the client registration process more flexible and accommodate various business scenarios where complete information may not be immediately available.

8. **Enhance Safety of the "clear" command**

Currently, after hitting Enter, the "clear" command will immediately delete all data without any confirmation. This can lead to accidental data loss if a user mistakenly types "clear" instead of another command.
This could lead to loss of data if there is any user error or misconception. 

Proposed Changes:
- Implement a confirmation dialog that appears when the user types "clear" and hits Enter
- The confirmation dialog will clearly state the consequences of the action and require the user to confirm before proceeding

These changes will make the "clear" command safer to use and reduce the risk of accidental data loss.
